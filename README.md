# Non-recursive-Predictive-Parsing

An implementation of Non-recursive Predictive Parsing method for a context free grammar as well as programs and algorithms to remove left recursion and left factoring.The Predictive parsing is a special form of recursive descent parsing, where no backtracking is required, so this can predict which production to use to replace the input string. Non-recursive predictive parsing or table-driven is also known as LL(1) parser.
